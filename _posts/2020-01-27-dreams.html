<p>The relationship between the Catcher and Umpire is vital at every level of the game. These relationships can have a positive effect on the game and strike-zone as well as a negative effect.  The line is pretty thin and there are a few unwritten rules to follow that will help you stay on the good side of your umpire and potentially changing the outcome of close calls.</p>

<p>Catchers are one of the only players on the field outside of your manager that can ask the tough questions, that when asked by the pitcher or hitter, can seem a bit insulting.</p>

<p>When the mutual-respect is there, the umpire will look to you as the middle-man between the pitcher, dugout and even the manager.  In most cases, your umpire will turn to you first before he makes a call on your pitcher for a balk, <em>“Tell your pitcher to come set.”</em>  If someone in the dugout is being too chatty, he might tell you, <em>“If he keeps it up, I’ll eject him.”</em></p>

<h2 class="section-heading">First Things First</h2>

<p>The very first thing any catcher should do when he gets behind the dish is to take off your mask, shake the umpire’s hand and introduce yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Just like you would do with anybody else :</strong> <br>
<em>“John Smith, nice to meet you”</em></p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
